                    Our people at ZOOD consists of Australian health professionals and highly qualified IT specialists who understand and believe in health without a border. Working as health professionals, we have witnessed many patients who could not afford the high cost or could not access the best treatment at home country. At the same time, we came across many skilled and award-winning doctors and clinics who offer high quality medical, dental and mindfulness services. We started to look for a solution to wipe down the confusion and make it easy and hassle-free to find the best health options without any burden or border.
